== Description ==

What I’m Currently Reading is a simple plugin to do one thing: tell the world what book you’re reading in the sidebar of your blog or website. The plugin gives you a widget that allows you to put in the title, author, and url for info of the book you’re reading, as well as customize the title of your widget and the default text if you’re not currently reading a book. There are several other plugins that allow you to keep a more detailed archive of your reading history, and if that’s what you’re looking for those plugins take care of you beautifully. This one is if you don’t need that kind of functionality, but would like to be able to quickly tell visitors what you’re reading.

== Installation ==

To use, simply activate, click on Appearance > Widgets, drag the widget into your sidebar and save.
